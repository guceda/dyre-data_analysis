1,Skura,180,50,,,180,100,200,25,220,25,"I don't think I can read books with this tool, I prefer traditional reading tool which can allows me to review what read and helps my to digest the whole things"
2,Ellinor,229,75,,,220,100,230,100,240,75,it adds reading more fun
3,T,204,75,,,200,50,210,75,220,50,"I like this tool, the yellow bar made me feel motivated, just like a game, it is keeping moving while I keep catching up"
4,Mahood,160,50,,,160,100,170,100,210,100,"previous reading tool helping me to read fast always give me  one word per time, the feeling is not good; while this reading tool giving me a short sentence with a yellow background helps me to keep being focused, unconciously, without much effort to force myself to focus"
5,Lisa,152,100,,,160,75,180,50,190,75,"I always read a sentence twice(return to the beginning of the sentence read again), this reading method changed my habit; When I study at parimary school I was told to read using finger to help eyes stick on the texts, this reading website has the similar effect, really help me to focus; I think this is a useful tool for reading in digital context."
6,Ara,268,25,195,100,250,100,300,100,330,100,It seems that the longer time she uses the app the faster she can read. She felt more confortable with the white background. Might be interesting to test with longer tests to focus more on concentration rather than on speed. Might want to consider a change of goal. We could talk to Jan about this.
7,Rebeca,145,75,,,-,-,230,75,250,75,She also prefers the white background. We should let the users play a bit with the app before testing in order to allow them to adapt to the system. She thinks we should temporary reduce the speed in the dots and commas. We probably need more texts.
