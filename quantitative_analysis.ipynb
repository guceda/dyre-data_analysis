    "- Do the pre-processing necessary to load the data into the analysis tool that is to be used for your project. While using R is recommended, the actual choice of tool is up to each of the groups.\n",
    "- Load your data into the analysis tool.\n",
    "- Identify which are your independent variables and which are your dependent variables (in the data which you have collected or generated). Write a description of the expected properties of each of these variables.\n",
    "Perform exploratory data analysis. Does your data have the expected properties? If not, can you identify why it does not?\n",
    "- Identify what statistical tools you will apply to analyze your data. If you have a model for the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables fit your data to this model. If you do not have a model, what could you to do identify a model, for example using principal component analysis?\n",
    "- Generate some visual aids (such as tables or graphs) to present your data to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: \n",
    "- Each group should exchange the output of the above with another group, then comment on the other groupâ€™s output. The goal is to help the other group improve their analysis and presentation.\n",

    "### Step 3: \n",
    "- Submit a summary of your planned data analysis and perhaps some illustrative images (plots, graphs, images) as appropriate.\n"
