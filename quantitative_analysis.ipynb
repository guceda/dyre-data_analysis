    "Perform exploratory data analysis. Does your data have the expected properties? If not, can you identify why it does not?\n",
    "- Identify what statistical tools you will apply to analyze your data. If you have a model for the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables fit your data to this model. If you do not have a model, what could you to do identify a model, for example using principal component analysis?\n",
